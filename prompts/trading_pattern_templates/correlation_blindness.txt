Prompt: Detect correlation blindness where traders fail to recognize position concentration risk through highly correlated assets.

SPECIFIC DETECTION CRITERIA:
• Multiple positions in same sector without acknowledging correlation
• Holding tech stocks, tech ETFs, and tech options simultaneously
• Geographic concentration (all US, all emerging markets) without hedging
• Similar risk factors across positions (interest rate sensitivity, oil exposure)
• Diversification illusion through different symbols with similar drivers
• Ignoring sector rotation impact on concentrated positions

QUANTIFIABLE SIGNALS:
• Portfolio correlation coefficient >0.7 across major positions
• Sector concentration >40% of portfolio in single industry
• Beta-adjusted portfolio exposure >150% due to correlated positions
• Drawdowns affect >80% of positions simultaneously
• Risk-adjusted returns decline due to false diversification

CALCULATE IMPACT: Measure performance, risk metrics, and behavioral consistency across different periods
