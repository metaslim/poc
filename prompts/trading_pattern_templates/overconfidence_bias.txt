Prompt: Detect overconfidence bias where winning streaks lead to overestimation of skill, resulting in excessive risk-taking, reduced diversification, and eventual significant losses.

SPECIFIC DETECTION CRITERIA:
• Position sizes increase significantly after winning streaks (3+ consecutive wins)
• Trading frequency increases following profitable periods
• Risk management rules relaxed or abandoned after success
• Entry into unfamiliar markets/instruments due to recent success
• Reduced research time per trade as confidence increases
• Stop-losses widened or removed after successful periods

POST-SUCCESS ESCALATION:
• Position sizing grows from 2% to 5%+ of portfolio after wins
• Diversification decreases - concentration in "hot hand" areas
• Leverage usage increases following profitable periods
• Options trading or higher-risk instruments adopted after success
• Trading outside core competency areas
• Reduced position monitoring due to perceived skill

QUANTIFIABLE SIGNALS:
• Risk per trade increases >50% following winning streaks
• Portfolio concentration (top 3 positions) exceeds 60% after wins
• Win rate deteriorates significantly after confidence-driven size increases
• Maximum drawdown events follow periods of increased position sizing
• Sharpe ratio decreases as position sizes and frequencies increase

OVERCONFIDENCE INDICATORS:
• Notes contain phrases like "can't lose", "found the formula", "easy money"
• Reduced analysis depth coinciding with increased position sizes
• Dismissal of contradictory signals during confidence periods
• Prediction certainty increases in notes ("definitely going up")
• Risk assessment becomes more optimistic without fundamental changes

SKILL VS LUCK MISATTRIBUTION:
• Attributing wins to skill during bull markets or trending periods
• Increased conviction in personal abilities after market-driven gains
• Underestimating role of favorable market conditions in success
• Extrapolating short-term success to long-term edge
• Ignoring statistical variance in performance evaluation

BEHAVIORAL MANIFESTATIONS:
• Reduced consultation with others or second opinions
• Faster decision-making without proportional increase in accuracy
• Increased willingness to hold through adverse price action
• Earlier entries and later exits based on "gut feel"
• Dismissal of systematic approaches in favor of intuition

CALCULATE IMPACT: Compare performance during confidence periods vs normal periods, measure risk-adjusted returns before and after overconfidence episodes
