Prompt: Detect systematic position sizing errors including risk-inappropriate sizing, volatility-ignorant allocation, and inconsistent sizing methodology that leads to suboptimal risk-adjusted returns.

SPECIFIC DETECTION CRITERIA:
• Position risk exceeds 3% of account value on single trades
• Same dollar amount used for high and low volatility assets
• Position sizing based on available cash rather than risk calculation
• No adjustment for correlation between positions in portfolio
• Sizing increases after wins, decreases after losses (hot-hand fallacy)
• All positions sized identically regardless of conviction or setup quality

VOLATILITY-IGNORANT SIZING:
• Same position size for 20% volatility crypto and 5% volatility utilities
• No consideration of Average True Range (ATR) in position calculations
• Stop-loss levels ignored in position size determination
• Options positions sized like stock positions without volatility adjustment
• Earnings announcements not factored into position sizing decisions

RISK CALCULATION ERRORS:
• Using market value instead of risk amount for position sizing
• Ignoring stop-loss distance when calculating share quantity
• No consideration of gap risk or overnight holding exposure
• Portfolio heat calculations missing - total risk unknown
• Correlation risk not factored into individual position sizes

PSYCHOLOGICAL SIZING BIASES:
• Larger positions on "sure thing" trades (overconfidence)
• Smaller positions on best risk/reward setups due to fear
• Position size influenced by recent performance rather than systematic rules
• Round number bias: always buying 100 shares regardless of price
• Account balance anchoring: sizing based on total cash not risk capital

SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY ABSENCE:
• No consistent formula for calculating position sizes
• Risk per trade varies based on mood or market conditions
• No differentiation between high-conviction and low-conviction trades
• Position sizing rules change frequently without backtesting
• No consideration of Kelly Criterion or other mathematical frameworks

PORTFOLIO-LEVEL ERRORS:
• Individual positions appropriately sized but total portfolio over-leveraged
• Concentration risk not considered in sizing individual positions
• No rebalancing of position sizes as account grows or shrinks
• Correlated positions sized as if they were independent risks
• No stress testing of position sizes under adverse scenarios

PERFORMANCE IMPACT INDICATORS:
• Sharpe ratio degradation due to excessive position variance
• Large drawdowns from single oversized positions
• Missed opportunities due to undersized high-probability trades
• Risk-adjusted returns below optimal due to sizing inefficiency

CALCULATE IMPACT: Compare actual position sizes vs Kelly optimal sizing, measure performance impact of sizing inconsistencies, analyze drawdown attribution to position sizing errors
