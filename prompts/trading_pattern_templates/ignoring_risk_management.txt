Prompt: Detect systematic violations of risk management principles including excessive position sizing, inadequate diversification, missing stop-losses, and ignoring portfolio heat limits.

SPECIFIC DETECTION CRITERIA:
• Individual position risk exceeds 5% of total account value
• No stop-losses set or stop-losses consistently moved against position
• Total portfolio risk exceeds 25% across all open positions
• Position sizing doesn't account for volatility differences between assets
• Correlation risk ignored - multiple correlated positions treated as diversified
• Leverage used without proportional reduction in position sizes

POSITION SIZE VIOLATIONS:
• Position sizes based on dollars available rather than risk-adjusted approach
• No consideration of asset volatility in position sizing calculations
• Same dollar amount used for low-volatility bonds and high-volatility tech stocks
• Position size increases after winning streaks without risk reassessment
• All-in mentality: using majority of account on single trade opportunity

STOP-LOSS DISCIPLINE FAILURES:
• Stop-losses set but repeatedly moved lower to avoid realization
• Mental stops used instead of hard stops, leading to emotional overrides
• Stop-losses placed at arbitrary levels rather than technical/volatility-based levels
• No stops on "investment" positions that become underwater traders
• Wide stops that risk more than 2-3% account value per trade

PORTFOLIO HEAT MISMANAGEMENT:
• Total risk across all positions exceeds prudent limits (>20-25%)
• No recognition of correlated positions adding cumulative risk
• Risk concentration in single sector, geography, or asset class
• No stress testing of portfolio under adverse market scenarios
• Position additions without considering existing exposure

DIVERSIFICATION FAILURES:
• False diversification: different symbols with same risk factors
• Concentration in single time horizon (all day trades or all long-term)
• Geographic concentration without hedging currency/country risk
• Single strategy reliance without backup approaches for different markets
• Ignoring correlation increases during market stress periods

LEVERAGE MISUSE:
• Using maximum available leverage without risk adjustment
• Leverage increases position sizes rather than maintaining same risk
• No consideration of leverage impact during volatile periods
• Margin calls treated as normal part of trading rather than warning signals

CALCULATE IMPACT: Measure maximum drawdown, risk-adjusted returns, and frequency of large losses vs accounts with proper risk management
