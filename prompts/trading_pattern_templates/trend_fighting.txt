Prompt: Detect trend-fighting behavior where traders consistently trade against established trends, attempting to catch falling knives or fade strong momentum without proper reversal signals.

SPECIFIC DETECTION CRITERIA:
• Long entries during clear downtrends below major moving averages
• Short positions or profit-taking during strong uptrends above resistance
• Buying stocks making new 52-week lows without reversal confirmation
• Selling stocks breaking out to new highs without distribution signals
• Contrarian positions against prevailing sector or market momentum
• Fighting trends across multiple timeframes simultaneously

FALLING KNIFE CATCHING:
• Buying steep declines without waiting for stabilization or base building
• Averaging down in stocks breaking major support levels
• Long positions in stocks with consistent lower highs and lower lows
• Buying during capitulation or panic selling without volume confirmation
• Entry during earnings disasters or fundamental deterioration
• Ignoring technical breakdown patterns like head and shoulders or double tops

MOMENTUM FADING PATTERNS:
• Shorting or selling during breakouts from consolidation patterns
• Taking profits too early in strong trending moves
• Fighting parabolic advances without overbought confirmation
• Selling into strength during sector rotation or thematic rallies
• Contrarian bets against established momentum without reversal signals
• Premature reversal calls based on minor pullbacks in strong trends

TREND IDENTIFICATION FAILURES:
• No recognition of trend direction across different timeframes
• Trading against daily trend while weekly/monthly trends align opposite
• Ignoring volume confirmation of trend strength or weakness
• Misidentifying consolidation patterns as trend reversals
• Using wrong timeframe analysis for position duration intended
• No distinction between correction and trend change

REVERSAL TIMING ERRORS:
• Attempting to pick bottoms without oversold bounce confirmation
• Calling tops without overbought distribution evidence
• No waiting for trend line breaks or moving average reclaims
• Ignoring momentum divergences that could signal continuation vs reversal
• Early entries without proper risk/reward given trend strength
• No confirmation from multiple technical indicators

FUNDAMENTAL VS TECHNICAL CONFLICTS:
• Buying value traps (fundamentally cheap, technically weak)
• Fighting technical trends with fundamental analysis alone
• Ignoring fundamental deterioration while fighting technical decline
• No consideration of earnings revisions trend vs stock price trend
• Sector rotation ignorance when fighting individual stock trends

MARKET CONTEXT IGNORANCE:
• Fighting individual stock trends without considering market regime
• Contrarian trades during risk-off periods when correlations increase
• Ignoring Fed policy impact on growth vs value trend leadership
• Missing macro trend changes affecting sector/style performance
• Trading against currency or commodity trends affecting stock sectors

RISK MANAGEMENT IN TREND FIGHTS:
• Wider stops needed but not implemented when fighting trends
• Position sizes inappropriate for counter-trend risk
• No recognition that trend-fighting requires different risk parameters
• Stop-loss levels placed at arbitrary points vs trend-based levels

CALCULATE IMPACT: Compare trend-fighting performance vs trend-following, measure success rate of counter-trend trades, analyze drawdown patterns during trend-fighting periods
