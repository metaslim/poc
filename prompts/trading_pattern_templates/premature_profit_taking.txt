Prompt: Detect premature profit taking where traders exit winning positions too early due to loss aversion and fear of losing unrealized gains, significantly reducing overall profitability despite high win rates.

SPECIFIC DETECTION CRITERIA:
• Winning trades closed within 1-2 days despite trending conditions
• Profit targets hit at first resistance rather than waiting for breakouts
• Selling immediately after small profits (1-3%) without technical justification
• Closing positions during temporary pullbacks in strong uptrends
• Taking profits at psychological levels (round numbers) rather than technical levels
• Exiting winners faster than the average time losers are held

LOSS AVERSION INDICATORS:
• High win rate (>70%) but low average win compared to average loss
• Profit/loss ratio consistently below 1:1 despite good entry timing
• Immediate profit-taking when trades become profitable same day
• Closing partial positions at first sign of profitability
• Notes showing fear of "giving back gains" or "locking in profits"

QUANTIFIABLE SIGNALS:
• Average winning trade held <3 days while losing trades held >7 days
• Average win amount <50% of average loss amount
• Maximum favorable excursion significantly exceeds actual realized profit
• Win rate >60% but overall profitability negative or minimal
• Profit-taking accelerates during volatile but upward-trending periods

OPPORTUNITY COST ANALYSIS:
• Comparison of exit price vs subsequent price movement shows missed gains
• Trend-following opportunities cut short by premature exits
• Strong momentum moves abandoned for small profits
• Position closed before reaching logical technical targets
• Early exits during earnings runups or breakout confirmations

BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS:
• Bird-in-hand mentality: preferring certain small gains over uncertain larger gains
• Regret avoidance: exiting to avoid potential future regret of giving back profits
• Mental accounting: treating unrealized gains as "house money" to be quickly secured
• Overweighting probability of reversal vs magnitude of continued move

CALCULATE IMPACT: Compare actual realized profits vs potential profits if held to technical targets or trend completion
