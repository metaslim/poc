Prompt: Detect overtrading behavior by analyzing trade frequency and quality. Look for: 1) More than 10 trades per day consistently, 2) Trades executed within minutes of each other without clear strategy, 3) High turnover ratio relative to account size, 4) Multiple entries/exits in same symbol within short timeframes, 5) Evidence of impulsive decision-making rather than planned execution. Consider transaction costs eating into profits and lack of patience for setups to develop.
