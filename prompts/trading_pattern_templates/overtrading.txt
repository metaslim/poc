Prompt: Detect overtrading patterns where excessive trading frequency destroys returns through transaction costs, reduced selectivity, and decision fatigue.

SPECIFIC DETECTION CRITERIA:
• Trading frequency >2 standard deviations above historical average
• Multiple entries/exits per day without systematic justification
• Round-trip trades (buy then sell same symbol) within same trading session
• Trading during low-volume/choppy market conditions
• Position turnover rate >300% monthly (holding period <10 days average)
• Making trades just to "do something" rather than waiting for setups

OVERTRADING TRIGGERS:
• Boredom trading: Trades during sideways/consolidation periods
• News-driven impulse: Multiple trades following each news event
• FOMO cascades: Chasing multiple different "hot" sectors/stocks daily
• Profit euphoria: Increasing frequency after winning streaks
• Loss recovery: Increasing frequency to "make back" losses quickly

QUANTIFIABLE SIGNALS:
• Sharpe ratio inversely correlates with trading frequency
• Transaction costs exceed 2% of portfolio value monthly
• Win rate drops below 45% during high-frequency periods
• Average trade profit decreases as frequency increases
• Time in market vs time researching ratio falls below 5:1

DECISION FATIGUE INDICATORS:
• Trade quality deteriorates throughout trading day
• Later trades show worse risk/reward ratios
• Position sizing becomes erratic with increased frequency
• Stop-loss discipline decreases with more daily trades
• Notes become shorter/less analytical with higher frequency

PORTFOLIO IMPACT METRICS:
• Monthly turnover exceeds 100% without systematic rebalancing
• Trading costs reduce net returns by >3% annually
• Correlation between number of trades and drawdown periods
• Best performing periods coincide with lower trading frequency
• Cash utilization stays above 95% (no patience for better entries)

SYSTEMATIC VS DISCRETIONARY:
• Deviation from original trading plan increases with frequency
• Trades outside primary strategy/timeframe increase
• Risk per trade decreases but total risk increases due to quantity

CALCULATE IMPACT: Compare returns per trade, transaction costs, and risk-adjusted returns across different frequency periods
