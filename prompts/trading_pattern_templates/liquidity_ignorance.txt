Prompt: Detect liquidity ignorance where traders fail to consider volume, market depth, and liquidity conditions, leading to poor execution, excessive slippage, and exit difficulties.

SPECIFIC DETECTION CRITERIA:
• Trading in symbols with daily volume <100K shares without size adjustment
• Position entries during pre-market or after-hours with minimal volume
• Large orders relative to average daily volume (>5% of ADV)
• Trading illiquid options with wide bid-ask spreads (>5% of underlying)
• Entering positions in thinly traded ETFs or small-cap stocks without liquidity analysis
• Ignoring volume spikes or drops when timing entries/exits

LOW VOLUME VIOLATIONS:
• Trading penny stocks or micro-cap securities with sporadic volume
• Options trading in far out-of-the-money or distant expiration contracts
• International ADRs or emerging market ETFs during off-hours
• Sector ETFs or niche products with minimal institutional interest
• Trading during holidays or market half-days with reduced participation

EXECUTION QUALITY PROBLEMS:
• Market orders filled at prices significantly different from quoted price
• Slippage consistently exceeds 0.5% on trades due to liquidity constraints
• Bid-ask spreads wider than 0.2% for large-cap stocks, 0.5% for mid-cap
• Fill times extended due to insufficient counterparty liquidity
• Partial fills requiring multiple transactions increasing costs

VOLUME ANALYSIS NEGLECT:
• No consideration of volume profile when planning entry/exit timing
• Trading against volume trend: buying on decreasing volume, selling on increasing
• Ignoring volume confirmation of price movements
• Position sizing ignores stock's typical trading range and volume patterns
• No awareness of volume patterns around earnings or news events

MARKET MICROSTRUCTURE IGNORANCE:
• No consideration of market maker presence and institutional flow
• Trading during lunch hours or end-of-day with reduced liquidity
• Ignoring Level II data showing thin order book depth
• No awareness of dark pool activity affecting visible liquidity
• High-frequency trading impact ignored in execution planning

TIMING AND SCHEDULING ERRORS:
• Trading European stocks during US market hours when EU closed
• Crypto trading during traditional market hours when volume concentrated in off-hours
• Bond ETF trading during equity market stress when liquidity disappears
• Commodity ETF trading without considering underlying futures market hours

COST IMPACT MEASUREMENTS:
• Transaction costs exceed 1% due to liquidity-related factors
• Market impact causes permanent price movement against position
• Opportunity cost from delayed exits due to liquidity constraints
• Multiple small trades needed instead of single efficient execution

CALCULATE IMPACT: Measure execution costs, slippage analysis, compare liquid vs illiquid instrument performance, analyze exit timing difficulties
