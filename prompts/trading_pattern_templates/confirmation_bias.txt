Prompt: Detect confirmation bias in trading behavior. Confirmation bias occurs when traders selectively interpret information to support their existing beliefs while dismissing contradictory evidence.

SPECIFIC DETECTION CRITERIA:
• Trades executed despite multiple technical indicators showing opposite signals
• Position entries when RSI shows overbought (>70) conditions but trader notes mention "still bullish"
• Ignoring stop-loss triggers and adding to losing positions with justifications like "temporary dip"
• Cherry-picking positive news while dismissing negative earnings or guidance
• Holding losing positions with notes containing phrases like "just a correction" or "market overreaction"
• Trading against clear trend reversals with explanations that dismiss the reversal

QUANTIFIABLE SIGNALS:
• Win rate drops below 40% on trades with contradictory signals
• Average holding time increases 2x+ on losing positions vs winning positions
• Position size increases on trades against technical signals
• Notes contain dismissive language about negative indicators (>3 instances)

BEHAVIORAL EVIDENCE:
• Trader notes show rationalization patterns ("market doesn't understand", "temporary weakness")
• Selective mention of supporting data while omitting contradictory metrics
• Continued buying during clear downtrends with fundamentally weak justifications
• Refusal to exit positions when original thesis is invalidated

CALCULATE IMPACT: Compare performance of trades with vs without contradictory signals
