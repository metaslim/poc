Prompt: Detect emotional trading patterns driven by fear, greed, frustration, or euphoria rather than systematic analysis.

SPECIFIC DETECTION CRITERIA:
• Trades executed within 30 minutes of major market moves (panic/FOMO entries)
• Position sizes that deviate significantly (>50%) from typical trade size without risk management justification
• Multiple rapid entries/exits in same symbol within short timeframes (<2 hours)
• Trading during high-volatility events (earnings, FOMC) with emotional language in notes
• Revenge trading: Immediately entering opposite position after a loss
• Weekend gap trading with impulsive Monday morning entries

EMOTIONAL LANGUAGE INDICATORS:
• Fear: "market crashing", "can't lose more", "getting out now", "too scary"
• Greed: "can't miss this", "easy money", "going all-in", "to the moon"
• Frustration: "stupid market", "should have known", "this is rigged"
• Euphoria: "printing money", "unstoppable", "found the secret"

QUANTIFIABLE SIGNALS:
• Sharpe ratio drops below 0.5 during emotional trading clusters
• Maximum drawdown increases >15% during high-emotion periods
• Win rate differs by >20% between calm vs volatile market days
• Position holding time standard deviation >3x normal during emotional periods

TIMING PATTERNS:
• Trading frequency spikes 3x+ after 5%+ market moves
• Trades clustered around market open/close without systematic reason
• Weekend research followed by impulsive Monday execution
• Late-night trading after hours with poor risk management

CALCULATE IMPACT: Compare emotional vs systematic trading performance and frequency
