Prompt: Detect inconsistent timing and time horizon patterns where traders mix incompatible timeframes, creating portfolio conflicts and suboptimal risk management across different holding periods.

SPECIFIC DETECTION CRITERIA:
• Day trading and swing trading same symbols simultaneously
• Position sizes inappropriate for intended holding period
• Stop-losses set for day trades used on swing positions
• Technical analysis timeframes mismatched with holding intentions
• Risk management rules inconsistent across different time horizons
• No clear distinction between scalping, day trading, and investing positions

TIME HORIZON CONFLICTS:
• Opening long-term position while actively day trading same sector
• Using 5-minute charts for position intended to hold for weeks
• Day trading volatility interfering with longer-term trend capture
• Short-term noise affecting longer-term position management decisions
• Mixing high-frequency and low-frequency strategies without separation

INCONSISTENT EXECUTION PATTERNS:
• Same symbols traded with different time horizons within days
• Position sizing ignores intended holding period (same size for 1-day vs 1-month)
• Entry criteria changes based on intraday emotions vs planned timeframe
• Exit strategies switch mid-trade between short-term and long-term approaches
• Risk per trade varies based on impatience rather than systematic timeframe rules

ANALYSIS MISMATCH INDICATORS:
• Using daily charts for scalping decisions
• Weekly trend analysis ignored in day trading
• Fundamental analysis applied to minute-by-minute trades
• Economic events considered for 30-minute positions
• Technical patterns from wrong timeframes used for entry/exit

PORTFOLIO COHERENCE PROBLEMS:
• Day trading gains offset by swing trading losses in same stocks
• Conflicting positions: long-term bearish while day trading long
• Risk management confusion due to multiple timeframe exposures
• Correlation increases when different timeframes converge negatively
• Capital allocation inefficient across competing time strategies

PERFORMANCE DEGRADATION SIGNALS:
• Returns inconsistent due to timeframe strategy conflicts
• Higher transaction costs from excessive timeframe switching
• Missed opportunities in primary timeframe due to secondary timeframe distractions
• Emotional decision-making increases when managing multiple timeframes
• Strategy effectiveness impossible to measure due to mixed approaches

CALCULATE IMPACT: Analyze performance by separating different time horizons, measure opportunity cost of timeframe conflicts, compare focused vs mixed-timeframe performance
