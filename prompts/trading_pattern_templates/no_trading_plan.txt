Prompt: Detect absence of systematic trading plan evidenced by inconsistent strategies, random entry/exit criteria, and lack of predefined rules for position management.

SPECIFIC DETECTION CRITERIA:
• No consistent entry criteria - trades based on "gut feeling" or daily whims
• Exit strategies change mid-trade without systematic reason
• Position sizing varies wildly without risk-based rationale
• Trading timeframes inconsistent (day trading then swing trading same symbol)
• No predefined stop-loss or profit-taking rules
• Strategy changes frequently based on recent wins/losses rather than performance data

INCONSISTENT BEHAVIOR PATTERNS:
• Technical analysis one day, fundamental the next, no systematic approach
• Trading different asset classes with no expertise or strategy differentiation
• Risk tolerance changes based on emotions rather than account conditions
• No consistent market session focus (sometimes pre-market, sometimes close)
• Entry sizes based on available cash rather than risk management rules

LACK OF SYSTEMATIC APPROACH:
• No written rules for when to enter, exit, or size positions
• Decision-making process varies trade to trade
• No backtesting or strategy validation before implementation
• Trading journal absent or inconsistent with minimal analysis
• No performance review process or strategy refinement methodology

REACTIVE VS PROACTIVE INDICATORS:
• Trades made in response to market moves rather than planned setups
• No preparation during market closed hours - all decisions made live
• Strategy pivots immediately after losses without adequate sample size
• No predetermined risk/reward ratios for trade evaluation
• Market scanning lacks systematic criteria or screening process

PLANNING DEFICIENCY MARKERS:
• Notes contain uncertainty: "not sure why I entered", "hope this works"
• No trade thesis documented before entry
• Exit timing determined by P&L rather than original plan
• Position management decisions made under pressure rather than predetermined
• No contingency plans for different market scenarios

PERFORMANCE IMPACT:
• Inconsistent performance across similar market conditions
• Strategy effectiveness impossible to measure due to constant changes
• No learning from mistakes due to lack of systematic review
• Emotional decision-making dominates over process-driven approach

CALCULATE IMPACT: Compare performance consistency, drawdown patterns, and decision quality between planned vs unplanned trades
