Prompt: Detect revenge trading patterns by identifying emotional responses to losses. Look for: 1) Position sizes that double or triple immediately after a losing trade, 2) Trades in new/unfamiliar symbols following losses, 3) Abandonment of stop-loss rules after consecutive losses, 4) Trading outside normal hours or strategy parameters after significant drawdowns, 5) Rapid-fire trades attempting to "get even" quickly, 6) Higher risk tolerance immediately following losses compared to normal behavior patterns.
