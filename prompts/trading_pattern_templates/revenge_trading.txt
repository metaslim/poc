Prompt: Detect revenge trading patterns characterized by impulsive, emotion-driven trades immediately following losses, typically involving increased risk-taking and abandonment of systematic approaches in attempts to quickly recover losses.

SPECIFIC DETECTION CRITERIA:
• Position sizes increase >100% immediately following realized losses
• New trades initiated within 30 minutes of stop-loss execution
• Trading in unfamiliar or higher-volatility symbols after losses
• Risk parameters abandoned: wider stops, larger position sizes, leveraged products
• Multiple trades in rapid succession following single large loss
• Trading outside normal market hours or time windows after losses

IMMEDIATE REACTION PATTERNS:
• Trade frequency spikes dramatically after losing trades (>3x normal rate)
• Time between loss realization and next trade <30 minutes consistently
• Market orders placed immediately after stop-outs without analysis
• Position sizes that violate normal risk management rules
• Switching from conservative to aggressive instruments (stocks to options)
• Trading in pre-market or after-hours sessions following daytime losses

ESCALATION BEHAVIORS:
• Progressive risk increase: 1x to 2x to 3x leverage after consecutive losses
• Moving from single stocks to sector ETFs or broad market products
• Options trading with shorter expirations and higher delta exposure
• Margin utilization increases significantly after loss events
• Account size percentage per trade doubles/triples from baseline
• Using credit or borrowing to fund revenge trades

STRATEGY ABANDONMENT INDICATORS:
• Normal entry criteria ignored in favor of quick profit opportunities
• Stop-losses widened beyond technical levels or removed entirely
• Fundamental or technical analysis skipped for rapid entries
• Predetermined trade plans overridden by loss recovery desires
• Risk-reward ratios deteriorate significantly (>1:3 risk/reward)
• Trading against established trends in hope of quick reversals

PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS MARKERS:
• Notes contain "need to make it back", "can't end red", "one more trade"
• Trading continues despite reaching daily loss limits
• Increased position sizes correlate with emotional state rather than opportunity
• Multiple account access: switching between accounts after losses
• Social media or forum posting increases around loss events
• Sleep patterns disrupted by extended trading hours for recovery attempts

SYMBOL AND INSTRUMENT CHANGES:
• Sudden trading in volatile stocks not previously in watch list
• Moving from blue-chip stocks to penny stocks or biotechs
• Options trading begins or increases dramatically after equity losses
• Cryptocurrency trading initiated following traditional market losses
• High-beta or meme stock trading correlated with loss events
• Sector rotation chasing based on recent gainers lists

TIMING PATTERN ANALYSIS:
• Trade clustering immediately after 9:30am if overnight losses occurred
• After-hours trading activity spikes following regular session losses
• Weekend or holiday trading in available markets after Friday losses
• Extended trading sessions attempting to recover before market close
• Pattern of late-day trades trying to recover from morning losses

RECOVERY ATTEMPT CHARACTERISTICS:
• "Home run" trade attempts with asymmetric risk/reward profiles
• All-in mentality: using significant percentage of available capital
• Correlation with high-impact news events for quick profit potential
• Trading earnings announcements or FDA approvals without research
• Momentum chasing in trending stocks without technical confirmation
• Contrarian bets hoping for quick reversals in declining assets

PERFORMANCE DETERIORATION METRICS:
• Win rate drops below 25% during revenge trading periods
• Average loss per trade increases while average gain decreases
• Maximum drawdown events coincide with revenge trading clusters
• Sharpe ratio becomes negative during emotional trading periods
• Risk-adjusted returns deteriorate significantly vs baseline periods
• Account recovery time extends as revenge patterns intensify

BEHAVIORAL SEQUENCE PATTERNS:
• Loss → Immediate analysis of "what went wrong" → Quick replacement trade
• Stop-loss hit → Anger/frustration → Larger position in similar setup
• Red day → Extended trading session → Multiple recovery attempts
• Streak of losses → Complete strategy abandonment → High-risk speculation
• Large single loss → Multiple small revenge trades → Compounding losses
