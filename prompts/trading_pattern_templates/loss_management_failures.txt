Prompt: Detect loss management failures including averaging down, loss chasing, and excessive holding of losing positions due to loss aversion and hope rather than systematic risk management.

SPECIFIC DETECTION CRITERIA:
• Multiple purchases of same symbol with decreasing average price (averaging down)
• Position size increases >30% immediately following losing trades (loss chasing)
• Positions held significantly longer when showing losses vs gains (loss aversion)
• Doubling down on losing positions without fundamental thesis change
• Stop-losses repeatedly moved lower rather than executed
• Risk escalation after losses to "make back" money quickly

AVERAGING DOWN PATTERNS:
• Adding to positions breaking technical support levels
• Dollar cost averaging into declining fundamentals
• Justifying additions with "cheaper" rather than "better" reasoning
• Ignoring technical breakdown while adding to position
• Position size doubles/triples at lower prices without proportional upside increase

LOSS CHASING ESCALATION:
• Switching to higher-risk assets (options, leveraged ETFs) after losses
• Taking opposite trades immediately after stop-outs (revenge trading)
• Moving from stocks to options after equity losses
• Increasing from 1x to 2x to 3x leveraged products
• Risk per trade increases >50% after losing streaks (3+ losses)

EXCESSIVE HOLDING PATTERNS:
• Average holding period for losers >3x longer than winners
• Converting day trades to swing trades when losing
• Stop-losses moved or removed to avoid realization
• "Investment" rationalization for failed trades
• Mental stops used instead of hard stops, leading to emotional overrides

PSYCHOLOGICAL MARKERS:
• Notes contain "getting a better price", "can't go lower", "need to make it back"
• Time between loss recognition and next trade <30 minutes (revenge)
• Refusal to admit original entry was mistimed
• Treating unrealized losses as "paper" rather than real risk
• Increased conviction as price falls without new fundamental data

RISK ESCALATION METRICS:
• Maximum loss potential increases >50% from original position
• Kelly Criterion violations (betting more than optimal based on edge)
• Risk-of-ruin probability increases above 5%
• Consecutive losing trades with increasing monetary losses
• Account drawdown accelerates (losses increase in magnitude)

PERFORMANCE CONSEQUENCES:
• Win rate drops below 30% during loss-chasing periods
• Loss aversion ratio: hold losers 2.5x longer than winners
• Maximum drawdown events coincide with loss management failures
• Sharpe ratio deterioration during chase periods
• Average loss per losing trade significantly exceeds average gain

CALCULATE IMPACT: Compare performance during loss management vs disciplined periods, measure holding period differentials, analyze risk escalation patterns and account health deterioration
