Prompt: Detect impulsive news reaction trading where positions are entered immediately following news releases without analysis, often resulting in poor timing and emotional decision-making.

SPECIFIC DETECTION CRITERIA:
• Trades executed within 30 minutes of earnings announcements
• Position entries immediately following Fed announcements or economic data releases
• Buying/selling within hours of breaking news without technical confirmation
• Trading during high-impact news events with increased volatility
• Panic selling during negative headlines or market crash news
• FOMO buying during positive catalyst announcements

IMMEDIATE REACTION PATTERNS:
• Market orders placed within minutes of news release
• Position sizes larger than normal during news-driven volatility
• Trading opposite to pre-news plan based on headline sentiment
• Multiple trades in same symbol following single news event
• Entry timing perfectly correlated with news publication times
• No waiting period for market reaction to settle before entry

NEWS EVENT CATEGORIES:
• Earnings beats/misses causing immediate position entries
• FDA approvals, clinical trial results for biotech stocks
• Federal Reserve policy announcements and interest rate decisions
• Geopolitical events: wars, sanctions, trade negotiations
• Corporate announcements: mergers, acquisitions, management changes
• Economic data: jobs reports, inflation data, GDP releases

EMOTIONAL RESPONSE INDICATORS:
• Trading frequency spikes on high news-flow days
• Position sizes increase during breaking news periods
• Normal risk management rules abandoned during news events
• Pre-planned strategies overridden by news sentiment
• Multiple position changes following single news item
• Trading outside normal market hours following after-hours news

POOR TIMING EVIDENCE:
• Entries at intraday highs following positive news
• Panic selling at intraday lows following negative news
• Buying into gaps that quickly reverse
• Selling before news-driven rallies have time to develop
• Entry timing shows no technical analysis or confirmation waiting

ANALYSIS ABSENCE MARKERS:
• No consideration of news already priced into current valuation
• Ignoring broader market context when reacting to individual stock news
• No differentiation between material and immaterial news impact
• Trading on rumors or unconfirmed reports
• No waiting for market digestion period to assess true impact

HEADLINE VS SUBSTANCE GAPS:
• Trading on sensational headlines without reading full reports
• Reacting to preliminary data that gets revised later
• Ignoring context that contradicts headline sentiment
• No verification of news source credibility or accuracy
• Trading on social media rumors before official confirmation

VOLATILITY MISMANAGEMENT:
• No position size adjustment for news-driven volatility increases
• Stop-losses inadequate for expanded price ranges during news
• No recognition that news creates temporary liquidity issues
• Risk management parameters not adjusted for event-driven uncertainty

CALCULATE IMPACT: Compare news-reaction trade performance vs planned entries, measure timing efficiency relative to news publication, analyze drawdown patterns during news events
